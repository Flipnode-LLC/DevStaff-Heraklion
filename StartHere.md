# What is DevStaff?

So, there's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete... 

> Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other -- somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. 


_This ^^ is what we wrote 6 years back. There's now more than 1,100 devs in our [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/)._


DevStaff is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: _technology_ and _software_. Our goal is to make Crete a better place for developers to live and work in!

## Interested?

Join the meet up, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas ! 

Discuss issues you've faced, discover new & better ways of working (together), chat about tech (geeky) stuff, help others!

## Attend Meetups

Make sure you configure your notification options on meetup.com in order to receive notifications about upcoming events!

## Join the chat
A big part of the community revolves around our a Slack group where you can find the latest tech news, interesting articles, random pieces of information and a lot of heated discussions! Click on the link [here](https://join.slack.com/t/devstaff/shared_invite/enQtNDYyNTI0NjUyMjczLWUyN2ZkOGJjYWQyMzU2MTE0MjViYTAxYWYxMjVlMzk2ZDk1N2I3ZGI2Y2MxMmMwN2JkNzY5MGUzMGRmN2NlNWM) to join. 

## Topics selection / Suggest

The Org team is responsible for curating topics and finding speakers for the upcoming meetups. Any member of the community is free to suggest new topics and also propose himself/herself for being the next meetup speaker on his/her favorite topic, by filling this form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-xubuaYZIl0kl1B5wqy_nIE-Rq010OfUEfAdMyoSA6S9jAg/viewform). The DevStaff Slack channel is also a great place to propose new topics to the Org team as well as pointing to speakers/topics that might be of interest to the community. So if you want to propose a topic, or you are available to make a presentation on a topic, go ahead and fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-xubuaYZIl0kl1B5wqy_nIE-Rq010OfUEfAdMyoSA6S9jAg/viewform) or head out to our Slack channel and drop us a line there! When there's interest in a certain topic the Org team actively tries to find more speakers willing to talk about it. There's always someone sharing the same passion with you!

One thing also worth noting is that although meetups are usually planned for 2-3 months ahead, changes can be made by the Org Team when required, including, but not limited to, opportunities for collaboration with other MeetUps, expert speakers that happen to be in Crete, etc.
